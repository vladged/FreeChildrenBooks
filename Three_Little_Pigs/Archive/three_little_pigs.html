Their mother, a kind and caring pig, gave them each a hug and warned them to be careful out in the world. The pigs, each with their own personality — silly, relaxed, and clever — waved goodbye and set off down the sunny path.",

The second pig, laid-back but a bit more practical, built his house out of sticks. But the third pig, the smartest of them all, wore his hard hat and glasses and took his time carefully building a sturdy brick house.",
